         <article>My Animal Kingdom is an independently operated not-for profit organization specializing in bringing awareness to the public of the cuteness of our pets, the joy 
            that comes from having them in our lives, and the benefits each of us can gain from making animals part of our families. Pets are generally incredibly well loved: 
            according to a 2015 Harris poll, 95% of owners think of their animal as a member of their family. About half buy them birthday presents. And it's a two-way 
            street. Nothing compares to the joy of coming home to a loyal companion. The unconditional love of a pet can do more than just keep you company. Pets may also 
            decrease stress, improve heart health, and even help children with their emotional and social skills. Owning a pet not only can have effects on physical health,
            but can also have a drastic effect on both your mental and emotional states. According to a study conducted in 2018, owning a pet increases your chances of being happy 
            and successful. Experts who polled 1,000 dog and cat owners, and 1,000 adults of the same age without a pet, found those with canine and feline companionships were 
            twice as likely to consider themselves happy. A similar study conducted in the UK in 2018 suggested that owning a pet increases levels of serotonin, dopamine, and 
            oxytocin each of which play a crucial role in happiness. I can say from experience that both my pets and those of my girlfriend have personally brought tremendous joy
            to my life. And because of that it is our mission here at My Animal Kingdom to not only spread the joy that our pets offer us, to the world, but to also bring this same awareness to
            the public so that everyone may experience the love and joy that pets bring.
