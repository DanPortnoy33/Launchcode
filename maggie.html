                <h1>Maggie the Cat</h1>
                <p>Maggie is an 11 year old, Toirtoiseshell cat that we recieved last July when my Aunt 
                    became too sick to take care of her. Two months later, my aunt passed away and Maggie
                    found her forever home with us. Maggie is a very independent cat who spends most of her 
                    time sleeping in her bed or hanging out on her cat tree. She loves being up high and you
                    will constantly find her on top of the counters and the cabinents. Maggie is a very vocal
                    young lady who has quite the personality. We often say that she is cranky because her standard
                    meow sounds as if she is complaining about your existence in her life. Maggie loves drinking from
                    the faucet and she will make sure that you know when it is time for you to turn it on. She loves being brushed,
                    sitting on your lap, and looking out the windows. Although she would never admit it, she loves her sister Lyla
                    very much and always watches her from a safe distance. We are so lucky to have Maggie in our lives.  &#x1F408
