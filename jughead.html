                <h1>Jughead the Cat</h1>
                <p>Jughead is a one year old tabby cat, that my girlfriend adopted last August. 
                    He was the cutest little kitten that you would ever meet and has grown up into
                    the most well-behaved and handsome boy. Jughead is my girlfriend's best friend and he holds a 
                    special place in my heart as well. Jug loves playing with his toys, watching the 
                    world go by out the window, and playing with his brother Archie. Although Archie is
                    in fact Jughead's brother by adoption, Jug doesn't really view him that way. To Jug
                    Archie is a toy (his favorite one) that he can play with, wrestle with and attack whenever he likes.
                    Before Archie came into the picture Jughead would always try to hide and pop out to attack us, but 
                    now that Archie is here Jug's primary focus is hunting Archie. Luckily Archie enjoys being hunted
                    by Jug and the two are literally inseperable. They eat together, use the litter box together,
                    sleep at the same time, and are constantly playing with eachother. They truly are eachother's bestfriends.
                    Jug also enjoys making bird noises and chirping at every turn. In the morning Jughead will come up to 
                    you, get on your chest, and meow in your face until you are awake. We truly are just both living in
                    Jug's world and there's nothing we would change about it.  &#x1F408
