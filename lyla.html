                <h1>Lyla the Pup</h1>
                <p>Lyla is a 7 year old lab-boxer mix that became part of our family on March 14th, 2014. 
                    Lyla is the sweetest dog that you will ever meet; she enjoys long cuddle sessions right
                    when she wakes up in the morning and when its time to go to bed. Although being 65lbs,
                    Lyla is not very spacially aware and she believes that she is still a lap-dog. She can be found
                    constantly trying to get onto your lap or attempting to lay on top of you when you are lying
                    down. She loves giving the kisses to both humans and dogs alike. Despite being a sweetie at heart,
                    Lyla is very protective of her home. One of Lyla's favorite things to do is to sit on the porch and
                    wait for people or other dogs to walk by just so she can bark at them. She gets very excited when they
                    come by so much so that the hair on her back stands up creating a mowhawk. Lyla's mortal enemy is the mailman
                    and the multiple UPS and Fedex delivery drivers that work in our neighborhood. Lyla absolutely loves walks, treats,
                    and meal time. She is on a special diet of weightloss kibble, carrots and on occassion canned pumpkin and mashed potatoes.
                    Lyla is a pup at heart in every way; her favorite activites include playing with her stuffed pig,
                    Mr. Oinkers, chewing on her plastic bones, going on long walks in the neighborhood, going to the park, and 
                    playing with the neighbor's dogs, Ottie and Bean. Lyla has an Uncle Steve, an Uncle Brian, and a Grandma who all love
                    her very much. Lyla also loves her momma and gets very excited every Saturday when her mom comes to see her. Despite 
                    her active nature, Lyla has never shied away from a good nap. She loves napping with daddy or taking solo naps
                    on her dog bed or her couch. Lyla also loves her sister Maggie very much, but oftentimes she forgets just how little Maggie 
                    is and ends up just chasing her away. Lyla truly is the best friend anyone could ever ask for, and were so lucky to have her in our lives. &#x1F43E;
