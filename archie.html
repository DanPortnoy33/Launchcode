                <h1>Archie the Cat</h1>
                <p id=testP>Archie is a one year old tabby cat that my girlfriend adopted from MauHouse this year. 
                    He is a glutton who loves to eat non-stop and drink from both the faucet and his fountain.
                    Despite being a head shorter than Jughead, Archie loves to play and wrestle with his brother. 
                    Archie's fearless and curious nature often lands him in loads of trouble with mom as he loves
                    to attempt to jump on anything that he can see no matter how tall or unsturdy. He loves playing with his
                    toys some of which include his electric butterfly, his laser, his taco, his leash, and even mom and
                    dad themselves. Despite his reckless affinity for biting mom and dad's hands and arms whenever visible, Archie
                    is a very sweet cat. He can often be found standing at your feet, weaving in and out of your legs as you walk and wrapping his
                    tail around them as you go. He loves snuggling with his momma and dadda and on occassion will even attempt to jump into his
                    brother's hammock to get some snuggs from him as well.  &#x1F408
